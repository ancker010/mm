## Raspberry Pi 4 Docker Host/Home Server - From Scratch

This post is mostly for my own notes, but others might find it helpful. Here I'll document the process of buying, building, booting, and configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) as a home server that runs various applications in Docker. Of course, you don't *need* necessarily need to do all of the steps below to get a functional server, this is just what I did to get my Pis up and running how I wanted them.
