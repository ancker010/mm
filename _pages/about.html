    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Harden. If you've made it here, you probably already know that. I have lots of hobbies but this page will be mostly centered on technology and higher education related items.</p>
    <p>I've spent the entirety of my professional career in higher education, a 7-year stint at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign and then a shift to the University of Chicago, where I've been for roughly seven years as well.</p>
    <p>My current title is "Research and Advanced Networking Architect", which is an extremely broad title that covers just about anything related to networking and research. I tend to focus on the researchy stuff, which I find way more interesting than enterprise networking.</p>
    <p>My latest pet project(s) are around network automation and scripting. I'm particularly interested in building CI/CD processes around network device configuration compliance and mitigation techniques.</p>
    <p>Expect a lot of the above and other random posts about the state of tech in higher education.</p>
    <p>Ciao!</p>
